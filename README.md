This is my first project while attending the MLH WEB3 GHW and exploring blockchains,smartcontracts

it is a basic voting dapp that allows user to vote using metamask wallet accounts ,ganache accounts provide 10 accounts each having some ETH which were used for comfirming the transaction and giving vote ,i also send some 
eth to new accounts to try sending crypto from one account to other.
